## Introduction
VTR-Gym project is a platform for exploring AI techniques in FPGA placement optimization. VTR-Gym connects [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) and [VTR](https://verilogtorouting.org/) in order to achieve seamless integration between  Python-based machine learning libraries and VTR, which allows researchers to focus on high-level algorithm design and reduces the engineering efforts required for transplanting ML libraries from Python to C++.

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning (RL) widely used in research. It provides a simple and standard way to represent an RL problem.

The Verilog to Routing (VTR) project is an open-source framework for conducting FPGA architecture and CAD research and development.
