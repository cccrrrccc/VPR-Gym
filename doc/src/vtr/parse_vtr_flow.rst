.. _parse_vtr_flow:

parse_vtr_flow
--------------
This script parses statistics generated by a single execution of the VTR flow.

.. note:: If the user is using the :ref:`vtr_tasks` framework, :ref:`parse_vtr_task` should be used.


The script is located at::

    $VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/scripts/python_libs/vtr/parse_vtr_flow.py

.. program:: parse_vtr_flow.py

Usage
~~~~~
Typical usage is::

    parse_vtr_flow.py <parse_path> <parse_config_file>

where:

  * ``<parse_path>`` is the directory path that contains the files to be parsed (e.g. ``vpr.out``, ``odin.out``, etc).
  * ``<parse_config_file>`` is the path to the :ref:`vtr_parse_config` file.

Output
~~~~~~
The script will produce no standard output.
A single file named ``parse_results.txt`` will be produced in the ``<parse_path>`` folder.
The file is tab delimited and contains two lines.
The first line is a list of field names that were searched for, and the second line contains the associated values.
