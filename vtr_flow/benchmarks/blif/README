The following are the twenty largest MCNC LGSynth93 circuits:

    adder.blif
    alu4.blif
    apex2.blif
    apex4.blif
    bigkey.blif
    clma.blif
    des.blif
    diffeq.blif
    dsip.blif
    elliptic.blif
    ex1010.blif
    ex5p.blif
    frisc.blif
    misex3.blif
    multiclock.blif
    pdc.blif
    s298.blif
    s38417.blif
    s38584.1.blif
    seq.blif
    spla.blif
    tseng.blif

They have been optimized via script.rugged and script.algebraic in SIS,
with the smaller output circuit generated by the two scripts taken in
each case.  They were then technology-mapped to 4-input look-up tables
and flip flops via Flowmap.
