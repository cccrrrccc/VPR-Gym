SymbiFlow architectures
=======================

This directory holds all the SymbiFlow architectures that are generated in the [SymbiFlow-arch-defs](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs) repository.

The data files needed to successfully run VPR are:
- Architecture XML definition
- RR Graph
- Router Lookahead
- Place delay matrix lookup

All the data files can be downloaded with the `make get_symbiflow_benchmarks` target in the root directory.
